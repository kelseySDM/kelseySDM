## What is SafeDM?

SafeDM is a new content-blocking filter designed to make the internet safer for all. It protects the user from viewing sensitive content, such as unsolicited nude photos, without their consent.

## Why SafeDM?

Because everyone should be able to participate in the conversation without fear of sexual harassment. [78% of millennial women report having been a victim of cyberflashing](https://today.yougov.com/topics/lifestyle/articles-reports/2017/10/09/53-millennial-women-have-received-dick-pic). SafeDM targets these types of messages and deletes them automatically.

## Can I Use it?
The filter will be available starting 2.14.20
